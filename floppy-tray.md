## Laser cutting

The floppy disk drive tray CAD design has 3 layers that must be processed in this order:

|    Layer Name   | Color | Operation | Required  |             Comment            | Processing Order |
|:---------------:|-------|:---------:|-----------|:------------------------------:|:----------------:|
|    engraving    | blue  |  engrave  | optional  | Contains only versioning label |         1        |
| floppy-tray-int | red   |    cut    | mandatory |          Internal cuts         |         2        |
| floppy-tray-ext | green |    cut    | mandatory |          External cuts         |         3        |

## Step by step instructions


1. Prepare the required material:

  * 1x floppy disk drive

  * 1x acrylic floppy tray
  * 2x acrylic spacers
  * 1x acrylic wing
  * 4x M3 8mm flat torx screws
  * 2x M3 14mm countersunk torx screws
  * 2x M3 countersunk washers
  * 2x M3 nuts

2. Turn the floppy drive and acrylic floppy tray upside down and attach the floppy tray to the floppy drive bottom using four M3 8mm flat torx screws

3. Turn the acrylic floppy tray again so that the floppy is in the normal orientation, and prepare to install the acrylic wing by placing the two acrylic spacers on top of the screw holes in the acrylic floppy tray
